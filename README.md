# Cutscene Manager

Wide intro into the pros/cons of different cutscene systems

Explanation on the current existing cutscene editors

Data driven code with generic approach

TODOs to both use and code the system

“A cutscene is a sequence in a video game that is not interactive, breaking up the gameplay.”
They are usually used to show conversation between characters, set the mood and introduce new gameplay features or incoming events.
There are two main types of cutscenes. The ones rendered in real time that use the gameplay graphics to create scripted events and the pre-rendered video “cinematic”.
Although, there are some more types like: “Live-action cutscenes”, which are recorded like a film, “Mixed media cutscenes”, which, as the name says mixes real time and pre-rendered graphics and finally, interactive cutscenes also known as quick time events.
The problem with pre-rendered graphics is that they cannot change according to the game state. However, real time cutscenes are specially thought for that, so the components of the scene will change in order to visualize the game state and the action that the player has done, so he feels more relevant to the game and more immersed. For example, if he has chosen to equip his character with a blue cape instead of a red one, it will be seen in the cutscene.
So, we will focus on the creation of a real time cutscene manager.
